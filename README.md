## Info
This is a Docker container which uses streamlink in a python container to record streams from twitch.tv.

From my testing each streamer uses round about 1MB/s so for example: 5 streamers = 5MB/S
### WARNING!!
Might be cpu-heavy depending on how many streamers you're recording at once

### Install
Get the Docker-compose.yml and adjust it to your preferences
